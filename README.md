# gerardroche/sublime_five_easy_color_schemes

Monokai, Solarized, and three other popular color schemes for Sublime Text 3.

*This is a work in progress. Please do not hesitate to open issues.*

The goal is to group a maximum of five schemes, each with a light and dark mode, in one package *(three have yet to be selected #1)*, ensure they are good, polished, well tested, and of the highest quality.
